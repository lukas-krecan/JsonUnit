JsonUnit
===========

JsonUnit is a library that simplifies JSON comparison in unit tests. It's strongly inspired by XmlUnit, although it much more primitive. The usage is
simple:

    import static net.javacrumbs.jsonunit.JsonAssert.assertJsonEquals;
    
    ...
    
    assertJsonEquals("{\"test\":1}", "{\n\"foo\": 1\n}");
    
    assertJsonPartEquals("2", "{\"test\":[{\"value\":1},{\"value\":2}]}", "test[1].value");
    
When the values are compared, order of elements and whitespaces are ignored. On the other hand values 1 and 1.0 are considered to be different.  

Sample output
-------------
For example 

    assertJsonEquals("{\n" +
			"   \"test\":[\n" +
			"      1,\n" +
			"      2,\n" +
			"      {\n" +
			"         \"child\":{\n" +
			"            \"value1\":1,\n" +
			"            \"value2\":true,\n" +
			"            \"value3\":\"test\",\n" +
			"            \"value4\":{\n" +
			"               \"leaf\":5\n" +
			"            }\n" +
			"         }\n" +
			"      }\n" +
			"   ],\n" +
			"   \"root2\":false,\n" +
			"   \"root3\":1\n" +
			"}",
			"{\n" +
			"   \"test\":[\n" +
			"      5,\n" +
			"      false,\n" +
			"      {\n" +
			"         \"child\":{\n" +
			"            \"value1\":5,\n" +
			"            \"value2\":\"true\",\n" +
			"            \"value3\":\"test\",\n" +
			"            \"value4\":{\n" +
			"               \"leaf2\":5\n" +
			"            }\n" +
			"         },\n" +
			"         \"child2\":{\n" +
			"\n" +
			"         }\n" +
			"      }\n" +
			"   ],\n" +
			"   \"root4\":\"bar\"\n" +
			"}");
			
Results in

	JSON documents have different structures:
	Different keys found in node "". Expected [root2, root3, test], got [root4, test].
	Different keys found in node "test[2]". Expected [child], got [child, child2].
	Different keys found in node "test[2].child.value4". Expected [leaf], got [leaf2].
	JSON documents have different values:
	Different value found in node "test[0]". Expected 1, got 5.
	Different values found in node "test[1]". Expected '2', got 'false'.
	Different value found in node "test[2].child.value1". Expected 1, got 5.
	Different values found in node "test[2].child.value2". Expected 'true', got '"true"'.

1. It's not much extensible. The interface is intentionally simple, extensibility might be added in the future. 
2. It's not possible to change number comparison strategy.
